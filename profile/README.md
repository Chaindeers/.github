#  OKN - Open Knowledge Network <img src="logo.png"  width="30" height="30">

## Democratizing Knowledge by Decentralizing Language Models 🌐⛓️

Democratizes AI creation. By allowing anyone to contribute specialized models.



## 💡 The Idea
The idea is to create a decentralized AI chatbot platform that allows users to connect their specific LLM models. This platform aims to foster collaboration among nodes by enabling them to communicate with each other. The goal is to leverage collective intelligence to generate more precise, accurate, and effective outputs in various domains.

***OKN*** addresses 
- Centralization Concerns: Traditional AI models are often centralized, raising concerns about data privacy and control

- Diversity in Language Models:
Users may have specific language models tailored to their needs or industries.

- Scalability and Performance:
Ensuring the scalability of the network as more users and models join.
